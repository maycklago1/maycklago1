Hello, my name is Mayck, and I'm from Brazil.

I've been studying programming for the past 6 months and recently started a Computer Science course to enhance processes, build connections, and understand teamwork dynamics in this field.

I'm eager to contribute to projects involving Python and continue expanding my knowledge of this language, although I'm open to learning other languages as well.
